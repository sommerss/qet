the first step... go download quarto. 

the second step... download the quarto extension on vscode (in a vscode for a new repo)

the third step... open the command palette and do quarto: create project

it will ask you what you want it to be named or something. just name it what your repo is named probably

the fourth step... I think the rest is pretty self explanatory just edit it like a fastpages site

the fifth step... open command palette and do quarto: render

it will open a local host 

if you want to publish it to your github then do quarto publish gh-pages in the terminal and then it will open with the link in your github !!
