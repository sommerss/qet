    "text": "the first step… go download quarto.\nthe second step… download the quarto extension on vscode (in a vscode for a new repo)\nthe third step… open the command palette and do quarto: create project\nit will ask you what you want it to be named or something. just name it what your repo is named probably\nthe fourth step… I think the rest is pretty self explanatory just edit it like a fastpages site\nthe fifth step… open command palette and do quarto: render\nit will open a local host (the local host will close when you close it on vscode and never open again. you need to render every time you want the local host to open. it will open in your vscode and in a seperate tab if you click on the link)\nif you want to publish it to your github then do quarto publish gh-pages in the terminal and then it will open with the link in your github !!\nmy personal opinion: I don’t like how difficult it is to switch stuff (color and etc) and the syntax is slightly different, but overall its just as easy to use and way easier and faster to host locally and to publish. it is a bit harder to open up but i overall enjoy it."

(such as print). since it says value = first + second number and then says return value, it is meant to add the two. the answer thing allows you to add the name of function (summing_machine) and then the values you want for the parameters, and then the final step which is printing.\n\ndef summing_machine(first_number, second_number):\n    value = first_number + second_number\n    return (value)\n\nanswer = summing_machine(29, 8)\nprint (answer)\n\nprint (answer + 1)\n\n37\n38"
